### 🚀 Creating a New Release

I use an automated CI/CD pipeline to streamline my deployment. To push a new release to Itch.io:

1.  **Commit** my changes to `main`.
2.  **Tag** the commit with a version number:
    ```bash
    git tag v1.0.0
    ```
3.  **Push** the tag to GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin v1.0.0
    ```

_The GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds, packages, and deploys the new version to the `web` and `windows` channels on Itch.io._

### 🔢 Versioning Strategy

I follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for my releases:

- **Major (v1.0.0):** Major milestones (e.g., core gameplay loop finished, jam submission).
- **Minor (v0.1.0):** Added features or content (e.g., new levels, new mechanics).
- **Patch (v0.0.1):** Bug fixes, balance tweaks, or documentation updates.

### 📦 Local Development

- **Engine:** Godot 4.7.1
- **Testing:** I use `F5` to run the project locally.
